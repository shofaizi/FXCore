# FXCore

FXCore will be an ecommerce app that will fetch real time data such as currency values and compare them to other currencies.
Users will be able to save daily their own data for tracking purposes.
FXCore's backend relies on Node.js and Express along with MongoDB. The front end will be constructed entirely with React using
React Router and components. For visual effects, I will add JavaScript's jQuery library and Chart.js to display graphs.
This project is in progress and entirely done by Shoaib Faizi.
